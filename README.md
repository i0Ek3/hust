## Roadmap

Well, in the first stage hust will be a demo to learning basic rust knowledge. In the second one, hust will expand to big guy which support some features to help people to do funny stuffs, I just don't know yet what it should like be, but one thing I know is hust will be useful and incredible. In the last stage, hust will be a known library to build things easily or not, but you guys got one thing: hust will be fun!
